      <description>We are very happy to announce that AISLER now supports LibrePCB projects, so you can upload and review LibrePCB projects directly on their website and order PCBs and stencils just with a few clicks! :-)

Why AISLER? AISLER, based in Netherlands, is a smart prototyping service for electronics. They provide PCBs, stencils and parts for electronic projects for an affordable price, and everything is made in Germany.
I met Felix and Patrick, the founders of AISLER, at FOSDEM 2018.</description>

      <description>The stable release 0.1.0 is out!
Since the release candidate 0.1.0 RC2 three weeks ago, no critical bugs were reported, so we decided to finally publish the stable release 0.1.0. The changelog compared to 0.1.0 RC2 is very short:
Changelog Library Editor:  Fix saving of library URL Fix saving of component property &amp;ldquo;schematic-only&amp;rdquo;  File Format Stability As this is an official stable release, the file format is also considered as stable and you can expect that any project created with that release will be loadable with future releases of LibrePCB.</description>

      <description>After two weeks of testing, we have a new release candidate ready with some bugfixes and usability improvements:
Changelog Control Panel:  Hide non-existent recent and favorite projects Hide debug tools in workspace settings dialog  Library Manager:  Don&amp;rsquo;t show 100% progress while extracting ZIP  Library Editor:  Fix saving of component symbol position/rotation (#356)  Schematic Editor:  Fix resizing of &amp;ldquo;Add Component&amp;rdquo; dialog caused by long device names  Board Editor:  Fix crash when trying to connect trace to pad without net Fix too high default width of the dock widget at the right Fix possibly hidden layers in footprint preview of the &amp;ldquo;Place Devices&amp;rdquo; dock Show warning in the &amp;ldquo;Place Devices&amp;rdquo; dock if no matching device found in library Set default board size to 100x80mm Set default grid interval to 0.</description>

      <description>Great news: Our first official release candidate is out! :-)
If you didn&amp;rsquo;t try LibrePCB already, now is the time to start using (or at least testing) LibrePCB for your next projects – we would love to get your feedback!
Project Status Please keep in mind that this is our very first release candidate, so you may encounter one or another bug or missing feature. Nevertheless, we think the application is in a very usable state now – you can download and create libraries, draw schematics, route multilayer PCBs and export Gerber files.</description>

      <description>The last blog post is already a few months ago, and many things happened in the meantime. Thus I would like to inform you about the current status of the project, what happened in past and what the next tasks are.
New Logo Our logo was originally downloaded from a free icon portal. Although it was legal (thanks to its permissive license), it&amp;rsquo;s not a good idea to use a free icon as a logo.</description>

      <title>LibrePCB Meets FontoBene</title>
      <link>http://librepcb.org/blog/2018-04-21_librepcb_meets_fontobene/</link>

      <description>Finally! LibrePCB has a fully functional stroke font which can be used on PCBs. So now you can place designators or other text items on silkscreen (or other layers) which of course are then exported into the generated Gerber files. The new font file format FontoBene was developed especially for LibrePCB.

Why a stroke font instead of OTF/TTF? It may sound strange to implement a primitive stroke font in 2018 when we actually have much more powerful TrueType and OpenType fonts since many years.</description>

      <description>The Free and Open Source Software Developers&amp;rsquo; European Meeting (FOSDEM) is a great event for developers and users interested in free software. It is hosted at the ULB Solbosch Campus in Brussels, Belgium. This year it takes place on February 3 / 4.

There are many different tracks available, but for us the most interesting one is the CAD and Open Hardware devroom. It contains talks about PCB design, FPGA design, SPICE simulation and open hardware in general.</description>

      <title>LibrePCB Has Switched to S-Expressions</title>

      <description>One major goal of LibrePCB is to use human readable files to represent libraries, projects and so on. This is important to let the user understand what the EDA tool actually does when modifying a schematic or board. In addition, a good file format is essential for version control systems to keep track of changes in libraries and projects.
But LibrePCB doesn&amp;rsquo;t just want to have some human readable file format.</description>

      <description>Here it is: The long awaited blog of LibrePCB!
It&amp;rsquo;s still very basic, but this will be improved some time ;)
From now on, we will use this blog to provide various information, e.g. announcements of upcoming events, release notes, development progress or technical explanations.
If you have any input regarding this blog or our website in general, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.</description>
