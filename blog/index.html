              <p class="lead">
                

<p>We are very happy to announce that
<a href="https://aisler.net/partners/librepcb">AISLER now supports LibrePCB projects</a>,
so you can upload and review LibrePCB projects directly on their website and
order PCBs and stencils just with a few clicks! :-)</p>

<p><a href="/img/aisler_demo_brushless_controller.png"><img src="/img/aisler_demo_brushless_controller.png" alt="LibrePCB Project at AISLER" /></a></p>

<h3 id="why-aisler">Why AISLER?</h3>

<p>AISLER, based in Netherlands, is a smart prototyping service for electronics.
They provide PCBs, stencils and parts for electronic projects for an affordable
price, and everything is made in Germany.</p>

<p>I met Felix and Patrick, the founders of AISLER, at
<a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2018/">FOSDEM 2018</a>. Patrick held the talk
<a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/cad_dr_format/">Proposal for an open and democratic Design Rule format</a>
and I gave an <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/cad_librepcb/">Introduction to LibrePCB</a>.
It turned out that we all have very similar opinions how development and
manufacturing of electronics could (and should) be improved. We all are trying
to bring EDA to a next level, for that reason they founded AISLER and I started
the LibrePCB project.</p>

<p>At FOSDEM Felix and Patrick offered me to integrate support for LibrePCB project
files into their website, to allow ordering PCBs by uploading LibrePCB projects.
And even more: For every order of an uploaded LibrePCB project they make a
donation to support the LibrePCB development!</p>

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

<p>To make this happen, I created the <a href="https://docs.librepcb.org/#cli">LibrePCB CLI</a>
which allows to automate the processing of LibrePCB projects. AISLER now uses
that CLI to automatically generate Gerber files of an uploaded LibrePCB project.
These Gerber files are then used to create the preview of the PCB, and to
manufacture it in their fab.</p>

<p><img src="/img/aisler_analyzing_librepcb_project.png" alt="Analyzing LibrePCB Project" /></p>

<p>In order to adjust the fabrication output settings (e.g. filenames) according
their needs, they patch the board file <code>boards/&lt;BOARDNAME&gt;/board.lp</code> with their
own settings. So you don&rsquo;t have to make any fabrication output settings by
yourself, they will be overwritten anyway.</p>

<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>

<p>As you may know already, LibrePCB allows to have multiple boards in one project.
Currently it&rsquo;s not possible to select the specific board you want to order, so
you will get an error when uploading a project with multiple boards. We will try
to fix this limitation, but in the meantime you could manually adjust the
project&rsquo;s file <code>boards/boards.lp</code> to remove all boards except the one you want
to order ;)</p>

<p>In addition, currently you have to manually create a ZIP archive containing the
project directory, and upload that ZIP afterwards. I started to work on a
solution to make this much easier.</p>

<p>Also it&rsquo;s not yet possible for AISLER to export the BOM directly from the
uploaded project because BOM export is still missing in LibrePCB. But you can
still order parts at AISLER by uploading a CSV file with all parts.</p>

<h3 id="try-it">Try it!</h3>

<p>Just ZIP and upload your LibrePCB project to <a href="https://aisler.net/">aisler.net</a>
to see the beautiful preview and to order the PCB :) It would be awesome if you
order PCBs at AISLER as this way you directly support the development of
LibrePCB!</p>

<p>Many thanks to Felix and Patrick from AISLER to make this happen, and for
supporting LibrePCB and other open source projects!</p>

              <p class="lead">
                

<p><strong>The stable release 0.1.0 is out!</strong></p>

<p>Since the release candidate 0.1.0 RC2 three weeks ago, no critical bugs were
reported, so we decided to finally publish the stable release 0.1.0. The
changelog compared to 0.1.0 RC2 is very short:</p>

<h3 id="changelog">Changelog</h3>

<h4 id="library-editor">Library Editor:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Fix saving of library URL</li>
<li>Fix saving of component property &ldquo;schematic-only&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="file-format-stability">File Format Stability</h3>

<p>As this is an official stable release, the file format is also considered as
stable and you can expect that any project created with that release will be
loadable with future releases of LibrePCB. So now you can really start using
LibrePCB productively :)</p>

<p><strong><em>Attention:</em></strong> <em>This is not the case for the development version (e.g. the
<code>master</code> branch of our Git repository), so you should really use this official
release for productive work instead of the development version!</em></p>

<h3 id="download">Download</h3>

<p>The release can be downloaded for all major operating systems at our download
page:</p>

              <p class="lead">
                

<p><strong>Great news: Our first official release candidate is out! :-)</strong></p>

<p>If you didn&rsquo;t try LibrePCB already, now is the time to start using (or at least
testing) LibrePCB for your next projects – we would love to get your feedback!</p>

<h3 id="project-status">Project Status</h3>

<p>Please keep in mind that this is our very first release candidate, so you may
encounter one or another bug or missing feature. Nevertheless, we think the
application is in a very usable state now – you can download and create
libraries, draw schematics, route multilayer PCBs and export Gerber files.
Unfortunately features like DRC, BOM export or buses are not implemented yet,
they will be provided in a future release.</p>

<p>If you encounter bugs, we would be happy if you report them to
<a href="https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/issues">our issue tracker</a>. As it&rsquo;s only
a release <em>candidate</em>, there is some time to fix the most critical issues until
the first <em>stable</em> release.</p>

<h3 id="file-format-stability">File Format Stability</h3>

<p>Until now, we always communicated that the file format is not considered stable.
Any change in the file format could break older projects, so generally it was
not recommended to use LibrePCB productively.</p>

<p>With this first release candidate we consider the file format to be stable,
so any future release should be able to open libraries and projects created
with this release candidate. Only if there is an extremely critical issue with
the file format we may still do a breaking change before publishing the stable
0.1.0 release – but that&rsquo;s very unlikely :)</p>

<p><strong><em>ATTENTION:</em></strong> <em>The file format is only considered stable for official releases
– any intermediate version (e.g. from nightly builds) may not be upgradeable in
the next release! So if you already used our nightly builds (or other binaries
built from the <code>master</code> branch), you have to switch to official releases now.
Nightly builds must really not be used for productive work. See
<a href="https://developers.librepcb.org/df/d30/doc_developers.html">developers information</a> and
<a href="https://developers.librepcb.org/da/dbc/doc_release_workflow.html">release workflow documentation</a>
for details.</em></p>

<h3 id="libraries">Libraries</h3>

<p>Our official and ready-to-use libraries can easily be installed with the library
manager integrated in LibrePCB. But as these libraries currently only contain
very few elements, we would be very happy to get pull requests
<a href="https://github.com/LibrePCB-Libraries">at the corresponding repositories</a> to
add much more elements!</p>

<h3 id="download">Download</h3>

<p>The release candidate can be downloaded for all major operating systems at our
new download page:</p>

<h4 id="https-librepcb-org-download"><a href="https://librepcb.org/download/">https://librepcb.org/download/</a></h4>

<p>Many thanks to all the contributors and sponsors making this release possible!
It was hard work of more than five years to bring out this first release. We
would really appreciate if you supported the development either with
contributions or donations (e.g. at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/librepcb">Patreon</a>).
Every dollar helps to keep this huge project alive ;-)</p>

<p>And now: Happy testing! :-)</p>

              <p class="lead">
                

<p>The last blog post is already a few months ago, and many things happened in the
meantime. Thus I would like to inform you about the current status of the
project, what happened in past and what the next tasks are.</p>

<h3 id="new-logo">New Logo</h3>

<p>Our logo was originally downloaded from a free icon portal. Although it was
legal (thanks to its permissive license), it&rsquo;s not a good idea to use a free
icon as a logo. Because we didn&rsquo;t have the copyright on it, it was not
guaranteed to be exclusively used by us (other projects could use the same icon
too).</p>

<p>As the <a href="https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/issues/6">corresponding issue</a> was
unresolved for more than three years (it was our 6th issue!), we decided to
start a <a href="http://99d.me/c/iab2">design contest at 99designs</a> to get a new logo.
And here&rsquo;s the winning design:</p>

<p><img src="/img/new_logo.png" alt="New Logo" /></p>

<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s quite similar to the old logo, just nicer ;-) Probably that&rsquo;s because
I already liked the old logo, and maybe also a little bit because it was (too)
hard for me to go with a completely different logo than the one we had for
several years&hellip; Anyway, I hope you like the new logo as much as I do :)</p>

<h3 id="latest-changes">Latest Changes</h3>

<p>It would be too much to explain all the changes from the last months, thus here
just a list of the most important pull requests merged:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/254">Use Jinja-like attribute substitution syntax</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/255">Improve PCB fabrication output generator</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/258">Add ability to place NPTH drills on boards</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/260">Implement airwires (aka &ldquo;rats nests&rdquo;)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/267">Provide installer for nightly builds</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/273">Use Transifex for translations</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/282">Bundle fonts used in schematics together with LibrePCB</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/299">Add command-line tool &ldquo;librepcb-cli&rdquo;</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/321">Refactor net segments concept and board/schematic editors</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The last one sounds innocent, but that&rsquo;s actually the change which (finally)
made the board editor really usable (it fixed many annoying bugs).</p>

<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>

<p>With all the changes from above, our
<a href="https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/milestone/1">milestone 0.1</a> is nearly
complete. That means that we are now feature-complete for our first release!</p>

<p>So you can expect the first official stable release very soon :-)</p>

<p>The open tasks are now:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/326">Define a development and release workflow</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/issues/185">Prepare and test file format upgrade procedure</a></li>
<li>Review the whole file format and make the last changes if needed</li>
<li>Create and publish the first release!</li>
</ol>

<p>So, stay tuned :)</p>
